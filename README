What is LilRocket?
==================

LilRocket is a standalone search webservice for Whoosh. It's roughly analagous
to the relationship between Solr & Lucene. LilRocket makes it easier for
multiple machines to share the same index and multiple processes to run at the
same time without fear of damaging the index or locked indexes.


How do I use LilRocket?
=======================

LilRocket runs as a standard process (not a daemon). You launch it by running::

    lilrocket.py

Optionally, if you want to override the default configuration, you should
provide a JSON configuration file like so::

    lilrocket.py [/path/to/lilrocket.json]
